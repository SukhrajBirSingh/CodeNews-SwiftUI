# CodeNews-SwiftUI

A simple news reader app build using SwiftUI.
<p float = "left" padding = 30px>
<Img src = "Screenshot/1.png" height = "220" width = "150" hspace = "10">
<Img src = "Screenshot/2.png" height = "220" width = "150" hspace = "10">
<Img src = "Screenshot/3.png" height = "220" width = "150" hspace = "10">


## What I Learned
* Learned to work with SwiftUI Lists and the Identifiable Protocol
* Used Navigation View to navigate between List and Detail View
* Advance State Management using Observer Design Pattern
* Learned to incorporate a UIKit component into SwiftUI by using WebKit to display web pages in the app.
